            <p>Thanks for stopping by to learn more about My-Finances. I developed this application to solve a personal
                problem and help my wife manage our personal finances. The problem: (1) our bank categorizes our
                transactions in a standard way that sometimes does not reflect what the transaction was about. For
                example, purchases in any given gas station, most of the time, will be gas-related. However, we all know
                that most gas stations in the U.S have convenience stores. Therefore, using a debit card to purchase
                something at the convenience store will be classified as gas. Given that the description of the store is
                the same as the gas station, it will be almost impossible to distinguish between a simple stop for
                snacks and a stop for gas; (2) the classification, at least for our bank at this moment, stays in the
                bankâ€™s online banking or mobile banking application, meaning that once we download the statement it does
                not include the assumed categories. To solve this problem, first I created a macro using VBA to organize
                the data in the Excel spreadsheet. It worked decently but I was not entirely satisfied.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-lg-6" style="text-align: justify;">
            <p>
                Sometime after, I was introduced to Python. After playing with it for some time, I challenged myself to
                migrate the macro to a Python script to categorize and clean the data. The result was great. I had much
                more control of the process, experimenting with much more freedom to play with the data using Pandas.
                However, I still had a problem that bugged me for months. I ran the script on my laptop, and then I
                transferred the output Excel file, with the cleaned data and transactions categorized, to my wife's
                computer. I did that using some knowledge of computer networking. But the process was so tedious that I
                was not happy. The solution: build a web application that I can host online so that my wife can access
                it directly on her computer, iPad, or iPhone. That was my challenge. I embraced that challenge and used
                some of my just learned new skills in full-stack web development. Using Django as backend and HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript as frontend, I built this application. I hope you like using the sample statement to see
                how this application can help you manage your personal finances.
